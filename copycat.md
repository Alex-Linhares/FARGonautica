# Recommended version

Our recommended copycat version is the one currently maintained by [Lucas Saldyt]((https://github.com/LSaldyt/copycat/) in Python 3. There you will find how to install and run copycat.  Note that Lucas and Alex are playing with the code in a new experiment; and contact us for info regarding how to participate.

---

**Undergraduate exercises**:
1. Install Copycat on your machine and run some of the examples discussed in the literature.
1. Create three copycat problems that are not discussed in the above literature
1. Consider the SME (Structure-Mapping Engine) discussed in the literature.  Could it solve the following problems? If so, how? If not, why not?
    - **abc : abd  ::  ijk : ?**
    - **abc : abd  ::  iijjkk : ?**
    - **abc : abd  ::  rppkkk : ?**
    - **abc : abd  ::  ijkl : ?**
    - **abc : abd  ::  xyz : ?**
1. Why is it claimed that analogy-making is part of perception?
1. How do analogy-making and perception interact in Copycat?  Are they different modules? If so, why?  If not, Why not?
1. What does the slipnet do?  Why the term "*slip*"?
1. What does the temperature do?  Do codelets regulate the temperature? Does temperature regulate the codelets?

**Programming challenges**:
1. Make the code in Python **robust**: can it solve a large number of interesting problems, with different random seeds, without breaking?
1. Design a GUI for the project co.py.cat.. using sgv files that can be displayed on a Jupyter Notebook.
1. Integrate the best implementation ideas from Joseph Aaron Hager's project and co.py.cat.

**Open Research Projects**:
1. Implement Copycat in Dr. [Abhijit Mahabal's Fluid Concepts framework](https://github.com/amahabal/Pyseqsee).
     - document how the implementation is done
     - document how others may use the framework in their own projects
     - document what, if anything, becomes easier/simpler under the framework
     - document necessary changes *to the framework itself* to accommodate *both* Copycat and SeqSee
     - Write up a paper, and teach us how to make the development of a FARG architecture easier.
